# Parse PE

you can convert dll / exe files into hex like this :

to know PE file / before that you should now :

Offset → addresses of specific parts of the PE file parts when stored on disk

RVA→ Relative addresses stored inside of the PE binary

VA→ Another name of Physical Address

## DOS header

The DOS header (also called the MS-DOS header) is a 64-byte-long structure that exists at the start of the PE file.

it’s not important for the functionality of PE files on modern 
Windows systems, however it’s there because of backward compatibility 
reasons.

This header makes the file an MS-DOS executable, so when it’s loaded
 on MS-DOS the DOS stub gets executed instead of the actual program.

Without this header, if you attempt to load the executable on MS-DOS
 it will not be loaded and will just produce a generic error.

```jsx
typedef struct _IMAGE_DOS_HEADER {      // DOS .EXE header
    WORD   e_magic;                     // Magic number
    WORD   e_cblp;                      // Bytes on last page of file
    WORD   e_cp;                        // Pages in file
    WORD   e_crlc;                      // Relocations
    WORD   e_cparhdr;                   // Size of header in paragraphs
    WORD   e_minalloc;                  // Minimum extra paragraphs needed
    WORD   e_maxalloc;                  // Maximum extra paragraphs needed
    WORD   e_ss;                        // Initial (relative) SS value
    WORD   e_sp;                        // Initial SP value
    WORD   e_csum;                      // Checksum
    WORD   e_ip;                        // Initial IP value
    WORD   e_cs;                        // Initial (relative) CS value
    WORD   e_lfarlc;                    // File address of relocation table
    WORD   e_ovno;                      // Overlay number
    WORD   e_res[4];                    // Reserved words
    WORD   e_oemid;                     // OEM identifier (for e_oeminfo)
    WORD   e_oeminfo;                   // OEM information; e_oemid specific
    WORD   e_res2[10];                  // Reserved words
    LONG   e_lfanew;                    // File address of new exe header
  } IMAGE_DOS_HEADER, *PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER;
```

## DOS Stub

The DOS stub is an MS-DOS program that prints an error message saying that the executable is not compatible with DOS then exits.

This is what gets executed when the program is loaded in MS-DOS, the
 default error message is “This program cannot be run in DOS mode.”, 
however this message can be changed by the user during compile time

## Rich Header

Rich Header is not actually a part of the PE file format structure and can be completely zeroed-out without interfering with the executable’s functionality, it’s just something that Microsoft adds to any executable built using their Visual Studio toolset.
